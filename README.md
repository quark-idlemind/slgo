# slgo — Second Life message layer in Go

The first piece of a Go rewrite of the C client one directory up: the
483 UDP messages in `message_template.msg`, as Go structs that encode
and decode themselves.

    go generate ./msg      # regenerate msg/messages_gen.go
    go test ./...

## Layout

    cmd/msggen/         reads message_template.msg, writes Go
    msg/types.go        UUID, Vector3, Quaternion, IPAddr, Info, ...
    msg/buffer.go       little endian read/write primitives
    msg/codec.go        the generic tag-driven encoder and decoder
    msg/framing.go      message numbers, packet header, zero coding
    msg/receive.go      the read goroutine
    msg/messages_gen.go generated: 483 messages, ~14700 lines

## How it works

The generator emits structs that carry the template's own vocabulary in
`ll` struct tags, and nothing else:

    // ChatFromViewer is Low 80, zerocoded.
    type ChatFromViewer struct {
        AgentData ChatFromViewer_AgentData `ll:"Single"`
        ChatData  ChatFromViewer_ChatData  `ll:"Single"`
    }

    type ChatFromViewer_ChatData struct {
        Message []byte `ll:"Variable,2"`
        Type     uint8 `ll:"U8"`
        Channel  int32 `ll:"S32"`
    }

    func (m *ChatFromViewer) MsgInfo() *Info          { return &infoChatFromViewer }
    func (m *ChatFromViewer) Encode() ([]byte, error) { return Marshal(m) }
    func (m *ChatFromViewer) Decode(b []byte) error   { return Unmarshal(b, m) }

`Marshal` and `Unmarshal` in `msg/codec.go` are the only code that knows
what `U32` or `Variable,2` mean on the wire. Consequences worth having:

- A new message, or a new block on an existing message, needs no code
  at all. Rerun the generator.
- A new *field type* is one line in `kindByName` plus a case in
  `encodeField`/`decodeField`, and one line in the generator's
  `goType` table. Nothing else.
- The generated file is boring enough to read, and diffing it after a
  template update shows exactly what Linden Lab changed.

Block quantifiers map to Go shapes, so the type system carries some of
the schema: `Single` is a struct, `Multiple 4` is a `[4]T`, and
`Variable` is a `[]T` with a one byte count.

Tags are parsed once per type and cached (`planCache`), not once per
packet. Encode and decode of a small message run in about 110ns with
2–3 allocations on an M-series laptop, which is far more headroom than
the protocol needs.

## Type mapping

| template | Go | wire |
|---|---|---|
| `U8` `U16` `U32` `U64` | `uint8` … `uint64` | little endian |
| `S8` `S16` `S32` `S64` | `int8` … `int64` | little endian |
| `F32` `F64` | `float32` `float64` | little endian IEEE 754 |
| `BOOL` | `bool` | one byte |
| `LLUUID` | `UUID` | 16 bytes verbatim |
| `LLVector3` | `Vector3` | 3 × F32 |
| `LLVector3d` | `Vector3d` | 3 × F64 |
| `LLVector4` | `Vector4` | 4 × F32 |
| `LLQuaternion` | `Quaternion` | 3 × F32 — see below |
| `IPADDR` | `IPAddr` (`[4]byte`) | 4 bytes, network order |
| `IPPORT` | `IPPort` (`uint16`) | 2 bytes, network order |
| `Variable N` | `[]byte` | N byte little endian length, then bytes |
| `Fixed N` | `[N]byte` | N bytes |

Everything is little endian except the packet sequence number, `IPADDR`
and `IPPORT`.

## Where the wire format came from

Read out of the working C client rather than assumed:

- Little endian integers: `queue16`/`queue32` in `queue.c` write
  `ptr[0] = value >> 0`.
- Big endian sequence number: `allocPacket` writes `data[1] = seq >> 24`.
- Message number framing — `nn`, `FF nn`, `FF FF hi lo`, `FF FF FF nn` —
  from the receive path in `s.c`, which demonstrably works against the
  live grid.
- Variable blocks take a one byte count: `p_InventoryDescendents.c`
  reads `read8(&n, ...)` and loops.
- Appended acks are stripped from the tail *before* zero expansion,
  per `s.c`.

One trap when reading viewer source against the template: field order
on the wire is the *template's*, not the order of the `add*()` calls.
`LLAgent::sendAgentUpdate` adds `Flags` right after `State`, but the
template puts `Flags` last and that is where it goes —
`nextBlock()` lays the block out from `template_data->mMemberVariables`
and `addData` fills it in by name.

Three places where this deliberately differs from the C:

1. **`LLQuaternion` is 12 bytes, not 16.** Settled by the viewer source:

       void LLTemplateMessageBuilder::addQuat(const char *varname, const LLQuaternion& quat)
       {
           addData(varname, quat.packToVector3().mV, MVT_LLQuaternion, sizeof(LLVector3));
       }

   `sizeof(LLVector3)`, three floats. `packToVector3` normalizes and
   then negates the vector part when W is negative, so the receiver can
   assume W is non-negative and recover it as sqrt(1 - x² - y² - z²).
   `PackQuaternion` and `Quaternion.W` in `msg/types.go` implement both
   halves.

   `Misc/genproc.c` maps it to `readVector4` — an easy mistake, since
   the type really is four floats *in memory* and only three on the
   wire. The C tree disagrees with itself about it: the generated
   `protos/q_AgentUpdate.c` writes `queueVector4` while the hand edited
   `messages/q_AgentUpdate.c` writes `queueVector3`.

   Worth recording that the obvious live experiment cannot decide this,
   because it looks like it can. Uncommenting the `queueAgentUpdate`
   call at `s.c:1267` draws a `CameraConstraint` (High 22) back from the
   simulator where the same run without it draws none, so a 114 byte
   `AgentUpdate` is accepted and acted on. That still proves nothing
   about the width: `LLTemplateMessageReader::decodeData` does not
   discard a short message, it calls `logRanOffEndOfPacket` and zero
   fills, so a 114 byte body against a 122 byte template would have
   been accepted identically. The message was also nearly all zeros, so
   a misread would have found zeros wherever it looked.

2. **Medium messages frame as `FF nn`.** `allocPacket` takes the marker
   byte from bits 8..15 of a code whose `0xFF` lives at bits 24..31, so
   it emits `00 nn` and any Medium message the C client *sends* is
   malformed. Receiving is fine, which is why `CoarseLocationUpdate`
   works and nobody noticed. `TestIDRoundTripAll` covers this.

3. **`IPPORT` is network order.** `genproc.c` maps it to `read16`
   (little endian). Linden Lab's `addIPPort` does `htons`, so big endian
   should be right — but no message using `IPPORT` is implemented in the
   C client, and the wiki gives the width (two bytes) while saying
   nothing about order; it states little endian only for the plain
   integer types. So this one is reasoned, not observed. Flagging it
   rather than burying it: if something using `IPPORT` ever misbehaves,
   look here first.

## Decoding is deliberately forgiving

Two rules in `Unmarshal`, both learned from the C client's failure mode:

- **Trailing bytes are ignored.** Linden Lab extends messages by
  appending blocks. `ImprovedInstantMessage` grew a `MetaData` block
  between the old template and the current one.
- **A missing trailing `Variable` block decodes as zero instances**
  rather than an error. The live grid accepts an `ImprovedInstantMessage`
  that stops before `MetaData` — verified by sending one and having it
  delivered — so we extend the same courtesy in the other direction.

Both rules turn out to match `LLTemplateMessageReader` exactly: at the
packet boundary it sets a Variable block's `repeat_number = 0` rather
than failing.

Where this package is *stricter* than Linden Lab: a truncated
fixed-size field is an error here, whereas `decodeData` logs
`logRanOffEndOfPacket` and substitutes zeros. Matching them would buy
interoperability on malformed packets at the cost of turning a real
bug into silent zeros, so this errors instead. Worth revisiting if a
message the grid genuinely sends ever trips it.

Any other short read is an error, and the error names the message,
block and field. Nothing in this package calls `panic`, `os.Exit` or
`log.Fatal` on bad input; that is the single thing that most needs to be
different from the C, where an unknown XML value type called `err(1,...)`
and took the whole client down.

## Receiving

`Receiver` reads datagrams and puts decoded packets on a channel:

    recv := msg.NewReceiver(conn)          // conn is a *net.UDPConn
    go func() { err = recv.Run(ctx) }()

    for p := range recv.C() {
        switch m := p.Message.(type) {
        case *msg.ChatFromSimulator:
            ...
        }
    }

`Run` blocks, so the caller decides where the goroutine lives. It
closes the channel on return, so `range` terminates. Cancelling the
context unblocks a read in progress via `SetReadDeadline`, which
`*net.UDPConn` supports; a cancelled `Run` returns nil rather than the
resulting timeout.

Each `Packet` is one of three things, and the doc comment says so:
`Message` set means it decoded, `Err` set means it did not and `Body`
holds the raw bytes, and both nil means the datagram carried only
acknowledgements. `Acks` is filled in either way — a packet whose body
is corrupt still releases whatever it was acknowledging, which is not
true of the C, where a bad body means the acks in the same datagram are
processed but the packet is then dropped on the floor.

Failures are delivered rather than swallowed. An unknown message number
produces a packet whose `Err` wraps `ErrUnknownMessage` with the raw
body attached, so a caller that meets a message this build predates can
see it, log it and continue. Only runt datagrams are dropped outright,
and they are counted.

The receiver deliberately does *not* acknowledge anything or track
sequence numbers. It hands `Header.Reliable` and `Header.Sequence` up
and lets the session layer decide, because retransmission and duplicate
suppression need state this layer has no business owning.

One read buffer is reused forever. That is safe because nothing in a
delivered `Packet` aliases it: the codec copies `Variable` fields, and
the header's extra bytes and any raw body are copied on the way out.
`TestReceiveNoAliasing` guards it.

When the channel is full the default is to block, which pushes back on
the network and lets the kernel drop datagrams — honest for UDP, but it
also stalls the caller's acknowledgements behind a slow consumer.
`DropWhenFull()` inverts that and counts what it discards.

## Tests

`go test ./...` covers:

- every one of the 483 messages through a populate/encode/decode/compare
  round trip, plus a re-encode byte comparison
- golden byte vectors hand-derived from `q_UseCircuitCode.c`,
  `q_PacketAck.c` and `q_CompletePingCheck.c`
- the `AgentUpdate` size cross-check against the C allocation
- message number framing for all 483, and the shape of each priority class
- packet header, appended acks, zero coding round trip and the C's
  extended 256-zero run form
- the two forgiveness rules, and that ordinary truncation still errors
- generator parse errors: 15 malformed templates, each expected to fail
  with a specific message

## Not done

No send path yet, and no session: nothing acknowledges, retransmits,
suppresses duplicates, assigns sequence numbers or notices a circuit
going away. No XML-RPC login and no AIS.

`Receiver` allocates a message per packet through `New`. At the packet
rates in the C client's stats — 600k in a long session — that is worth
a pool eventually, but not before there is something to measure.
